Video Relevance Prediction based on Content


Video relevance prediction is one of the most important tasks for online streaming service. Given the relevance of videos
and viewer feedbacks, the system can provide personalized recommendations, which will help the user discover more
content of interest. In most online service, the computation of video relevance table is based on users’ implicit feedback,
e.g. watch and search history. However, this kind of method performs poorly for “cold-start” problems - when a new video
is added to the library, the recommendation system needs to bootstrap the video relevance score with very little user
behavior known.
