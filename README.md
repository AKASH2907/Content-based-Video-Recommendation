Video Relevance Prediction based on Content

   As a part of ACM Multiledia 2018 Grand Challenge, we participated in this challenge which is conducted by HULU organization.Due to legal issues, we don't have access to the videos of TV Shows and Movies. So, based on the features of InceptionV3 network and Convolution 3D network, we predicted videos based on the feature analysis.

   Video relevance prediction is one of the most important tasks for online streaming service. Given the relevance of videos
and viewer feedbacks, the system can provide personalized recommendations, which will help the user discover more
content of interest. In most online service, the computation of video relevance table is based on users’ implicit feedback,
e.g. watch and search history. However, this kind of method performs poorly for “cold-start” problems - when a new video
is added to the library, the recommendation system needs to bootstrap the video relevance score with very little user
behavior known.

   Several approaches have been done using collabartive filtering methods. However,this kind of method performs poorly on “cold-start” problems - when a new video is added to the library, the recommendation system needs to bootstrap the video relevance score with very little user behavior known.
